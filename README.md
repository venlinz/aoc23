## Advent of code 2023
[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) event happens once every year,
in which we are given a problem with two parts.

This repo contains solutions to Year 2023 problems.

In this repo I use my own C library, if you want run
the C code from this repo, kindly refer to [Clib](https://github.com/venlinz/clib)
repo.

each day's solution directory will have ```./build.sh```,
which you can run by making it executable.
this will only if you have successfully configured the Clib.

Thanks ;)
