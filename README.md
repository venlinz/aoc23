## Advent of code 2023
[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) event happens once every year,
in which we are given a two part problem every from Dec 1 to Dec 25(Advent calendar).

This repo contains solutions for Year 2023 problems.

In this repo I use my own C library, if you want run
the C code from this repo, kindly refer to [Clib](https://github.com/venlinz/clib)
repo on how to configure Clib.

each day's solution will be organized in a directory, which should contain ```./build.sh```,
which you can run by making it executable.

Thanks ;)
